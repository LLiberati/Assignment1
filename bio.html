                BORN TO ROCK </b>
                <br><br>
                Terry Dene was born in December 1938 in London at St Thomas Hospital, near the Embankment, just before World War II. <br> <br>
                At the age of 15 he felt oppressed by the educational system and left school to look for a job.  He saw an advert to work for HMV as a record packer in Oxford Street.  The association of the job to the music sparked Terry’s interest and he soon started his working day half an hour before time to listen to all the new releases coming from the USA.  <br> <br>
                It was 1956 and the music spectrum had given birth to the likes of Frankie Laine, Johnny Ray, Little Richard and of course, Elvis Presley.  <br> <br>
                As rewarding as ‘record packing’ might have been to anyone else, it soon became clear to Mr  Tollyfield, the Manager at HMV, that Terry  Williams was clearly not there for that reason.  After discovering at the back of the packing department, a boiler room that made a great sounding echo Terry, ignoring Tollyfield protests, made this room his personal singing niche. <br> <br>
                Tollyfield of course failed to understand, like many others afterwards, that this free spirit with a temperament closer to a Latin Lover than an Anglo Saxon, was a dart aiming at a target.  <br> <br>
                 Ignoring Tollyfield, his complaints, his threats and the very Bourgeois respectability that he was determined not to conform to, Terry started to use the boiler room as his own personal rehearsing room.
                
                <br> <br><b style:”font-weight: larger”>
                THE BEGINNING OF AN ERA </b>
                <br> <br>
                Soho was the centre point of rock and skiffle together with venues like, The Cat’s Whisker, The Macabre and Heaven and Hell.  <br> <br>
                Terry had already sung at the Cat’s Whisker one night that Leon Bell & his Bellcats were staging their act.  He sang Blue Suede Shoes and tore the roof off the place blowing Leon Bell out of the back door.   By 24 January 1957 he was fronting Rory Blackwell at the Razzle Dazzle Club (as Studio 51 was known on the Thursday nights rock’n’roll scene), billed as ‘the new singing sensation Terry Williams’.<br> <br>
                But it was the 2Is Coffee Bar that Terry was really interested in.  The place that saw the birth of the likes of Tommy Steele, Adam Faith, The Vipers Skiffle Group and Chas McDevitt. <br> <br>
                The place used to get jam packed and by this time Terry had gained as much confidence and determination as he needed to get on stage one night and play a few songs: <br> ‘Can you sing?’, <br> the band had asked: <br> ‘You give me a chance and I’ll show you.’ <br>  had been Terry’s reply.  
                <br> <br> 
                The 2Is Coffee Bar was managed by 2 wrestlers, Paul Lincoln and Ray Hunter.  Not many know that Paul Lincoln was also known as Dr Death in the wrestling circle.   That night Paul heard Terry sing, but it was Dr Death who recognised the winner in him and decided to launch his rise to fame.  <br> <br>
                Terry was asked to return the following week, to meet Hyman Zhal from Fosters Agents after his act, brought to Hyman’s flat in Park Lane and told: ‘I will make you a star.‘  All in one night.  <br> <br>
                Whether or not wrestling and music feed off the same crowd, is debatable, but it was clear that in Dr Death’s mind they did.  He asked Terry to perform at the Royal Albert Hall Welterweight Championship wrestling match to which the new TV music show ‘6.5 Special’ producer Jack Good and Dick Rowe, Decca Record’s impresario, had been meticulously invited.   The untamed wrestling crowd was silenced, the unknown ‘rock’n’roll singer announced by a metallic voice and Terry like a Christian thrown to the lions strummed up his guitar and sang his first song. <br> <br>
                The crowd subdued slightly ‘as if’ to listen, Terry’s voice as clear as a bell through the hung down mic made its way through the protesting crowd and by the third song, the place erupted! <br> <br>
                Decca signed him up for 3 years, Jack Good gave him a number of dates on the ‘6.5 Special’ and his name was changed to Terry Dene. <br> <br>
                <b style:”font-weight: larger”>
                STILL WATERS RUN DEEP </b>
                <br><br>
                Decca’s first choice for Terry was a song by Marty Robbins called ‘A White Sport Coat and a Pink Carnation’.  *  In the first seven weeks the song sold in excess of 350,000 copies and together with Stairway of Love, and ‘Start Movin’ at number 14, put his records in the Top 20 twice in the same year UK Single Chart and secured his name in the Guinness Book of Records. <br> <br>
                
                If the axiom ‘never judge a book by its cover’ is loosely applied it was tailor-made for Terry.  Terry’s smooth appearance was a total betrayal to his real identity.  <br>  Living inside him, there was a tiger ready to come out at the first opportunity.  The untamed beast was kicking the same old fuss that every beast in every’one’ worth being ever has: real freedom. <br> <br>
                
                It certainly wasn’t with White Sport Coat or Lucky Lucky Bobby, that Terry would find a release to the drive he had within.  And seen the results of his marriage to Edna Savage, it wasn’t with love either.  <br> 
                His frustration became evident in many ways including a few arrests for being drunk and disorderly.  But not evident enough for Decca or anyone else around him to realise what was really going on inside him.  In fact Decca, rather than giving this ‘live wire’ the right bone to chew,  dispensed him with ‘lukewarm ballads‘ that Terry didn’t like. Had Zahl really understood him, he would have never concocted a ‘public speech’ where Terry was to reassure his fans that he would give up drinking and start behaving like the ‘good boy’ he was expected to, almost admitting a presumable inability to ‘fit the bill’.  But what was the bill? <br> <br>
                The bill would have been to please the so called Bourgeois respectability and mould Terry into being just another product of the music industry, another Billy Fury, Tommy Steel or Cliff Richard.  <br> 
                Terry wasn’t like that, he wasn’t even like Elvis Presley, Terry wasn’t like any other.  Original and unpredictable Terry was his own person.  Born free he didn’t want to be controlled by anything or anyone, not by the industry the media, in fact, not even by his own career.  <br> He wasn’t there to profess good behaviour or promote his own image, he was there for he had been recognised as one of the best voices of his era,  if not the best, with all the drive, the aggression and stamina that was required to fit ‘that’ bill.  <br> <br>
                Terry was the real rock’n’roll McCoy inevitably rocking not only the audience but, the boat of conventionality. <br> <br>
                 A pioneer in his own right and  ahead of his time, by 1958 Terry, after ripping out a telephone box from the wall whilst claiming his passionate love for Edna Savage, was branded the ‘bad apple’ and the exemplifier of all  abomination of rock’n’roll. <br> <br>
                <b style:”font-weight: larger”>
                COM’ON SARGE, GIVE ME A BREAK </b>
                <br><br>
                Terry was conscripted to National Service in 1958 and was expected to report to Winchester Barracks of the King’s Royal Rifle Corps on 7 July of that year, but as a result of his career, his call up was deferred.  <br><br>
                Terry’s father had been an army officer for the King’s Royal Rifles Regiment for 6 yearrs and had proudly taken part of Ghandi’s security force. during his service in India.   When Terry was called up to the army, he saw this as the opportunity to honour his father’s career and was determined to join  the forces no matter what. <br><br>
                For Hyman Zahl this was an opportunity to glorify Terry’s name and career, possibly his own too,  and together with the newspapers, he arranged for  Terry’s call-up to national service to be filmed and photographed.  Everyone welcomed the idea, including the military, except Terry.  <br><br>
                Terry was thinking it was all a very bad idea, whilst looking at the adjutant, who, like a ballet dancer, was now running excitedly all around the barracks making sure that everything had been taken care of.  <br>  Terry was thinking: ‘when has it ever been heard of anyone receiving red carpet treatment for simply carrying out their duty?’ … he felt completely uneasy but by this time, Zhal had already made the arrangements.  Before all of this was over, he was being threatened by angry inmates and after the photo shoot, the threats became even worse.  <br><br> By this time the adjutant, now worried, took Terry to an isolation room and stationed him there for the night.  <br>Terry felt it was all o-t-t and wanted to go back to the barracks but when he asked to see the sergeant one of the military staff replied: ‘It is out of your hands now, they are worried about your safety.’  <br><br>
                In the meantime, Edna had announced divorce proceedings on the phone, and Terry like a lion in a cage was now pacing the room in a fit of anger and ripped the fatal telephone box off the wall.  <br><br>
                The next day he was transferred to Netley Hospital where he was kept ‘under observation’ for another 2 weeks.  By this time the press haunting him, the authority were trying to decide what to do with him next. <br><br> In reality, they wanted to keep control of the situation. <br><br>
                They sent him to a civilian hospital where he remained for nearly 8 weeks and although it was an open hospital, he was still under military supervision. <br> After two months he was finally discharged. <br><br>
                 He had never entered the barracks again and never really served the service he had intended to serve. <br><br> Terry was furious.  <br><br> Before he left Terry was brought before the military board and offered a pension for life.  When he refused one of the chief officers asked him: ‘Do you think you will get your career back?’  Terry replied: ‘You tell me sir.’ <br><br>
                <b style:”font-weight: larger”>
                REVELATION </b>
                <br><br>
                When Terry came out, he had had enough.  <br>
                Everything around him seemed to crumble like sand as if led by a prophetic curse that had a life of its own.  <br><br>
                Edna divorced him, the press crucified him, Zahl vanished in the background and Decca, well Decca, had, no doubt, bigger fish to fry.  <br><br>
                Terry’s passion for life, music and love, seemed pointless to him now.  Tired of the insignificant transience of life, he started wondering what really was there to trust.  If everything could slip through his fingers like sand, what was really left for him to hold on to?  It seemed pretty clear that no love, no fame, no summit would be worth his while if they all shared the same doom.  Terry was looking for something permanent. <br><br>
                One night, he started walking the streets of London, feeling like a broken cup unable to fill. <br> It was 1964 and standing in one corner of Trafalgar Square, was an Evangelist preaching about Christ.  Terry stopped, looked at him, and he saw this man had something he didn’t.  ‘I want what you have.’  He said. <br><br>
                The man asked him to kneel, put a hand in his shoulder and prayed. Terry felt a charge. A new hope was born in him.  Something he hoped had the everlasting power he was yearning for. <br><br>
                He turned his back to the British pop scene and became an Evangelist crossing over to singing and writing spiritual and gospel music. <br> He recorded two gospel albums, ‘I called to the wind’ and ‘If that isn’t love’ and an EP called ‘Terry now’ that were released in 1972-73 on Pilgrim Records.  <br> He travelled abroad as an itinerary preacher playing in churches, prisons, schools and wherever the tide took him.  He settled at the Scandinavian Lutheran Church for four years in Sweden where he married for the second time and had a child.  Marie-Luise. <br><br>
                He met Dan Wooding, a Christian journalist, who released a book about him, ‘I thought Terry Dene Was Dead’, which was pieced together using mainly newspapers clips because the book Terry was really interested in was the Bible. <br><br>
                <b style:”font-weight: larger”>
                REAL LOVE </b>
                <br><br>
                If Terry had found in Christ the rock he had been looking for, he still had not found the love of his life. <br> The one that could piece it all together in one real significant swoop.  <br> <br> His second marriage failed, then his third and then his fourth, leaving him yet again on his own and yet again wondering, what life was all about and indeed if real love existed at all.  <br> <br> Music still playing a small part in the background, Terry reformed his group if half-heartedly, with Brian Gregg, in 1984 and called it the Dene Aces.   <br> But it wasn’t music he was looking for. <br>  Terry was looking for love.  <br> <br> Not the fickle type, but the one that clicks right into place bringing everything into prospective and injecting life into it.    <br> Too real and passionate about anything else, Terry didn’t want to settle for anything less. <br> <br> 
                 It was 1999, and yet again alone and forlorn he wandered the meanders of the ‘Tin Pan Alley’ still dear to his heart, one day, as if trying to get back to his roots. <br>  When he reached Greek Street, there stood a tiny little place called Kool Kafe’, right opposite the stage door of the Palace Theatre.  <br> As he entered, he was introduced to Lucia Liberati, a real Countess from Italy. <br><br>
                For the first time, way beyond physical beauty, he saw an aura that struck him.  <br><br>
                There was something about her, that he could not ignore.  <br><br>
                As he sat there, sipping a newly found sap, he felt at home.  <br> As his past unfolded from him to her, he saw her tears.  <br> ‘You’re real‘ <br>  He said. <br>  ‘Why, is there any other way to be?‘  <br> Her smile had no frivolity.
                <br><br>
                Lucia Liberati <br><br>
                <b>
                From Our Own Words </b> <br><br>
                Conventionality is the inability to express one’s own individuality or exercise one’s own free will. <br>  I dream of a world where our will imposes no clash with the almighty’s. <br><br>
                Together, Terry and I, intend to pursue this aim by rocking whatever boat we have to.  <br> The times a’changed, all it is now left for us to say is: <br> <br> <b style:”font-weight: larger”>Ready when you are!</b>
